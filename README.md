# Extracting-sequences-in-computer-games-logs
Project for Development Workshop classes - model based on computer games logs.

## The dataset
![BIRAFFE2](https://zenodo.org/record/3865860#.XvjpwecwhPY)

## Current state:
- Event searching - will be used for HMM
- Stage visualization with event logs, example:

Map of stage 1. with scattered data on each participant's death.
![Stage1](/stage_1_deaths.jpg?raw=true "Map and data on deaths from stage 1")

Map of stage 2. with scattered data on each participant's death.
![Stage2](/stage_2_deaths.jpg?raw=true "Map and data on deaths from stage 2")
